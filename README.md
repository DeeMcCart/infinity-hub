## About
---------
Welcome to Infinity Health Hub, the premier online forum dedicated to providing tailored support for neurodivergent women at every stage of life. With a focus on how neurodiversity and life-stage interact in health considerations, Infinity Hub offers a safe and inclusive space where members can connect, share experiences, and access targeted health support. From sexual and mental health guidance in young adulthood to tailored reproductive health resources and holistic care guides during pregnancy, postnatal periods, and menopause, Infinity Hub is committed to empowering neurodivergent women to thrive across all life stages. Join our community and discover the support you need to navigate your well-being effectively and authentically.

This site was created as part of a Code Institute hackathon in conjunction with Trust in Soda, April 2024. 

### Responsiveness
The site is built, with the help of Bootstrap 5, to be fully responsive so it can be used on a range of devices.

## Problem Statement
----------------
It is increasingly recognised that many more neurodivergent women exist than has previously been recognised or acknowledged by the medical and social professions.  This means there are a significant number of women living without a diagnosis, who carry the significant cognitive burden of 'masking'.  Masking refers to concealing aspects of ourselves, in order to be accepted and granted the same priviledges as neurotypical persons.

Females Hormones fluctuate at certain lifestages, which means:
* Teenage girls with neurodiversity are much more likely to engage in risky behaviour
* Postpartum females are more likely to suffer from Post-Natal depression 
* Perimenopausal women (remember this can go on for up to 10 years)  in their late 40's/ early 50's, who have masked their way through their career, are more likely to burn out and exit formal employment at thhis point.

While resources and sites do exist, these tend to quite 'crowded' with difficult-to-filter information, or focus on one particular type of neurodivergence (in practice, women will often be dealing with more than one).

Few of the existing resources allow females to tailor the information seen based on their life-stage.  Life-stage: young adult/ pregnant/ postpartum/ perimenopausal - affects hormone levels and certain additional stressors are predictable by female life-stages.

For people who expend considerable effort on 'masking', the process of unmasking, or being open about individual struggles, can be very uncomfortable without the assurance of a safe and supportive environment.  From the chat groups surveyed, it was not clear that they were able to provide this environment.


## Project Goals
----------------
1. Provide a clear, informative set of resources on neurodivergent conditions and how these affect females.
2. Filter content to the **users** lifestage and neurodiversity
3. Safe space to allow for progressive reveal rather than abrupt unmasking.
4. Provide a forum for peer-to-peer discussion between site members.
5. Provide moderation to preserve site safety and security for forum discussions
6. Provide an explanation of the InfinityHub ethos and principles.
7. Provide a means for further contact to be made with the site owners.
8. Which uses the capabilities of Django, HTML, CSS and Javascript.
9. And is accessible, responsive and relevant.

### UX Design Strategy
Focus is on abilty for the user to interact with content most relevant to their needs.

### UX Design Strategy Analysis of Competitors
(image here of the competitor analysis from google sheet)

The findings when looking at existing sites (based on search term 'neurodiversity female site' ) was that....


The gaps in their offering are a lack of filterable content,.....

### UX Design Strategy Target Audience
The target audience is females, who are aged 16+, and are living with one or mor neurodivergent conditions

## Validation 

### HTML Validation 
- HTML
HTML validation was performed for the various site pages as follows:  Render the page via the app, right click on the page contents and take option to copy (rendered) source.  Paste this into a file and subject that file to the W3C validator.
